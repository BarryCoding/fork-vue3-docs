# Reactivity Fundamentals {#reactivity-fundamentals}

:::tip Professional Tips
Many experienced Vue.js developers define reactive data **exclusively with ref()** due to the limitations of reactive()
:::

## Declaring Reactive State \*\* {#declaring-reactive-state}

### `ref()` \*\* {#ref}

The recommended way to declare reactive state is using the [`ref()`](/api/reactivity-core#ref) function:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
```

`ref()` takes the argument and returns a ref object with a `.value` property:

```js
const count = ref(0)

console.log(count)        // { value: 0 }
console.log(count.value)  // 0

count.value++
console.log(count.value)  // 1
```

> See also: [Typing Refs](/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-ref) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

To access refs in a component's template:

```vue-html
<div>{{ count }}</div>
```

:::tip
Notice that we did **not** need to append `.value` when using the ref in the template.  
For convenience, refs are automatically unwrapped when used inside templates (with a few [caveats](#caveat-when-unwrapping-in-templates)).
:::

You can also mutate a ref directly in event handlers:

```vue-html{1}
<button @click="count++">
  {{ count }}
</button>
```

### `<script setup>` \*\* {#script-setup}

When using [Single-File Components](/study/components/sfc). We can simplify the usage with `<script setup>`:

```vue{1}
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

function increment() {
  count.value++
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">
    {{ count }}
  </button>
</template>
```

:::tip
**Top-level** imports, variables and functions declared in `<script setup>` are automatically usable in the template of the same component. Think of the template as a JavaScript function declared in the same (top level) scope - it naturally has access to everything declared alongside it.
:::

### Why Refs? \*\* {#why-refs}

You might be wondering why we need refs with the `.value` instead of plain variables.

When you use a ref in a template, and change the ref's value later, Vue automatically detects the change and updates the DOM accordingly. This is made possible with a dependency-tracking based reactivity system. When a component is rendered for the first time, Vue **tracks** every ref that was used during the render. Later on, when a ref is mutated, it will **trigger** a re-render for components that are tracking it.

In standard JavaScript, there is **no way to detect** the access or mutation of **plain variables**. However, we can intercept the get and set operations of an **object's properties** using **getter and setter** methods.

The `.value` property gives Vue the opportunity to detect when a ref has been accessed or mutated. Under the hood, Vue performs the **tracking in its getter**, and performs **triggering in its setter**. 

Conceptually, looks like this:

```js
// pseudo code
const myRef = {
  _value: 0,
  get value() {
    track()
    return this._value
  },
  set value(newValue) {
    this._value = newValue
    trigger()
  }
}
```

### Deep Reactivity {#deep-reactivity}

Refs can hold any value type, including deeply nested objects, arrays, or JavaScript built-in data structures like `Map`.

:::tip
A ref will make its value **deeply reactive**. This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:
:::

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

const obj = ref({
  nested: { count: 0 },
  arr: ['foo', 'bar']
})

function mutateDeeply() {
  // these will work as expected.
  obj.value.nested.count++
  obj.value.arr.push('baz')
}
```

Non-primitive values are turned into reactive proxies via [`reactive()`](#reactive), which is discussed below.

:::tip shadowRef()
For shallow refs, only `.value` access is tracked for reactivity. Shallow refs can be used for **optimizing performance** by avoiding the observation cost of large objects, or in cases where the inner state is managed by an external library.

### DOM Update Timing {#dom-update-timing}

When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that **the DOM updates are not applied synchronously**. Instead, Vue buffers them until the **next tick** in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the [nextTick()](/api/general#nexttick) global API:

```js {1,6}
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

async function increment() {
  count.value++
  // Before the DOM is not updated
  await nextTick()
  // Now the DOM is updated
}
```

## `reactive()` \*\* {#reactive}

Unlike a ref which wraps the inner value in a special object, `reactive()` makes an object itself reactive:

```js
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
```

> See also: [Typing Reactive](/senior/typescript/composition-api#typing-reactive) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

Usage in template:

```vue-html
<button @click="state.count++">
  {{ state.count }}
</button>
```

Reactive objects are [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and behave just like normal objects. The difference is that Vue is able to intercept the access and mutation of **all properties** of a reactive object for reactivity tracking and triggering.

`reactive()` converts the object **deeply**: nested objects are also wrapped with `reactive()` when accessed. It is also called by `ref()` internally when the ref value is an object. 

Similar to shallow refs, there is also the [`shallowReactive()`](/api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive) API for opting-out of deep reactivity.

### Reactive Proxy vs. Original \*\* {#reactive-proxy-vs-original}

It is important to note that the returned value from `reactive()` is a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) of the original object, which is not equal to the original object:

```js
const raw = {}
const proxy = reactive(raw)

// proxy is NOT equal to the original.
console.log(proxy === raw) // false
```

:::tip
**Only the proxy is reactive** - mutating the original object will not trigger updates. Therefore, the best practice is to **exclusively use the proxied versions of your state**.

To ensure consistent access to the proxy, calling `reactive()` on the same object always returns the same proxy, and calling `reactive()` on an existing proxy also returns that same proxy:
:::

```js
// calling reactive() on the same object returns the same proxy
console.log(reactive(raw) === proxy) // true

// calling reactive() on a proxy returns itself
console.log(reactive(proxy) === proxy) // true
```

:::danger Deep reactivity
Due to **deep reactivity**, nested objects inside a reactive object are also proxies:
:::

```js
const proxy = reactive({})

const raw = {}
proxy.nested = raw

console.log(proxy.nested === raw) // false
```

### Limitations of `reactive()` \*\* {#limitations-of-reactive}

The `reactive()` API has a few limitations:

1. **Limited value types:** it **only** works for **object types** (objects, arrays, and [collection types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects#keyed_collections) such as `Map` and `Set`). It cannot hold [primitive types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) such as `string`, `number` or `boolean`.

2. **Cannot replace entire object:** since Vue's reactivity tracking works over property access, we must always keep the same reference to the reactive object. This means we can't easily "replace" a reactive object because the reactivity connection to the first reference is lost:

   ```js
   let state = reactive({ count: 0 })

   // the above reference ({ count: 0 }) is no longer being tracked
   // (reactivity connection is lost!)
   state = reactive({ count: 1 })
   ```

3. **Not destructure-friendly:** when we destructure a reactive object's **primitive type property** into local variables, or when we pass that property into a function, we will lose the reactivity connection:

   ```js
   const state = reactive({ count: 0 })

   // count is disconnected from state.count when destructured.
   let { count } = state
   // does not affect original state
   count++

   // the function receives a plain number and
   // won't be able to track changes to state.count
   // we have to pass the entire object in to retain reactivity
   callSomeFunction(state.count)
   ```


## Ref Unwrapping Details \*\* {#additional-ref-unwrapping-details}

### As Reactive Object Property \*\* {#ref-unwrapping-as-reactive-object-property}

A ref is automatically unwrapped when accessed or mutated as a property of a reactive object. In other words, it behaves like a normal property :

```js
const count = ref(0)
const state = reactive({
  count
})

console.log(state.count) // 0

state.count = 1
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

If a new ref is assigned to a property linked to an existing ref, it will replace the old ref:

```js
const otherCount = ref(2)

state.count = otherCount
console.log(state.count) // 2
// original ref is now disconnected from state.count
console.log(count.value) // 1
```

Ref unwrapping only happens when nested inside a deep reactive object. It does not apply when it is accessed as a property of a [shallow reactive object](/api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive).

### Caveat in Arrays and Collections \*\* {#caveat-in-arrays-and-collections}

Unlike reactive objects, there is **no** unwrapping performed when the ref is accessed as an element of a reactive array or a native collection type like `Map`:

```js
const books = reactive([ref('Vue 3 Guide')])
// need .value here
console.log(books[0].value)

const map = reactive(new Map([['count', ref(0)]]))
// need .value here
console.log(map.get('count').value)
```

### Caveat when Unwrapping in Templates \*\* {#caveat-when-unwrapping-in-templates}

Ref unwrapping in templates only applies if the ref is a top-level property in the template render context.

In the example below, `count` and `object` are top-level properties, but `object.id` is not:

```js
const count = ref(0)
const object = { id: ref(1) }
```

Therefore, this expression works as expected:

```vue-html
{{ count + 1 }}
```

...while this one does **NOT**:

```vue-html
{{ object.id + 1 }}
```

The rendered result will be `[object Object]1` because `object.id` is not unwrapped when evaluating the expression and remains a ref object. To fix this, we can destructure `id` into a top-level property:

```js
const { id } = object
```

```vue-html
{{ id + 1 }}
```

Now the render result will be `2`.

Another thing to note is that a ref **does** get unwrapped if it is the final evaluated value of a text interpolation (i.e. a <code v-pre>{{ }}</code> tag), so the following will render `1`:

```vue-html
{{ object.id }}
```

This is just a convenience feature of text interpolation and is equivalent to <code v-pre>{{ object.id.value }}</code>.
