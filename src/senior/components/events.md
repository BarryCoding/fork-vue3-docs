## Emitting and Listening to Events {#emitting-and-listening-to-events}

A component can emit custom events directly in template expressions (e.g. in a `v-on` handler) using the built-in `$emit` method:

```vue-html
<!-- MyComponent -->
<button @click="$emit('someEvent')">Click Me</button>
```

The parent can then listen to it using `v-on`:

```vue-html
<MyComponent @some-event="callback" />
```

The `.once` modifier is also supported on component event listeners:

```vue-html
<MyComponent @some-event.once="callback" />
```

Like components and props, event names provide an automatic case transformation. Notice we emitted a camelCase event, but can listen for it using a kebab-cased listener in the parent. As with [props casing](/guide/components/props#prop-name-casing), we **recommend** using kebab-cased event listeners in templates.

:::tip
Unlike native DOM events, component emitted events do **not** bubble. You can only listen to the events emitted by a direct child component. If there is a need to communicate between sibling or deeply nested components, use an external event bus or a [global state management solution](/guide/scaling-up/state-management).

## Event Arguments {#event-arguments}

It's sometimes useful to emit a specific value with an event. For example, we may want the `<BlogPost>` component to be in charge of how much to enlarge the text by. In those cases, we can pass extra arguments to `$emit` to provide this value:

```vue-html
<button @click="$emit('increaseBy', 1)">
  Increase by 1
</button>
```

Then, when we listen to the event in the parent, we can use an inline arrow function as the listener, which allows us to access the event argument:

```vue-html
<MyButton @increase-by="(n) => count += n" />
```

Or, if the event handler is a method:

```vue-html
<MyButton @increase-by="increaseCount" />
```

Then the value will be passed as the first parameter of that method:

```js
function increaseCount(n) {
  count.value += n
}
```

:::tip
All extra arguments passed to `$emit()` after the event name will be forwarded to the listener. For example, with `$emit('foo', 1, 2, 3)` the listener function will receive three arguments.

## Declaring Emitted Events {#declaring-emitted-events}

A component can explicitly declare the events it will emit using the [`defineEmits()`](/api/sfc-script-setup#defineprops-defineemits) macro:

```vue
<script setup>
defineEmits(['inFocus', 'submit'])
</script>
```

The `$emit` method that we used in the `<template>` isn't accessible within the `<script setup>` section of a component, but `defineEmits()` returns an equivalent function that we can use instead:

```vue
<script setup>
const emit = defineEmits(['inFocus', 'submit'])

function buttonClick() {
  emit('submit')
}
</script>
```

The `defineEmits()` macro **cannot** be used inside a function, it must be placed directly within `<script setup>`, as in the example above.

The `defineEmits()` macro also support an object syntax. If using TypeScript you can type arguments, which allows us to perform runtime validation of the payload of the emitted events:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const emit = defineEmits({
  submit(payload: { email: string, password: string }) {
    // return `true` or `false` to indicate
    // validation pass / fail
  }
})
</script>
```

If you are using TypeScript with `<script setup>`, it's also possible to declare emitted events using pure type annotations:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const emit = defineEmits<{
  (e: 'change', id: number): void
  (e: 'update', value: string): void
}>()

// 3.3+: alternative, more succinct syntax
const emit = defineEmits<{
  change: [id: number]
  update: [value: string]
}>()
</script>
```

More details: [Typing Component Emits](/senior/typescript/composition-api#typing-component-emits) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

Although optional, it is recommended to define all emitted events in order to better document how a component should work. It also allows Vue to exclude known listeners from [fallthrough attributes](/guide/components/attrs#v-on-listener-inheritance), avoiding edge cases caused by DOM events manually dispatched by 3rd party code.

:::tip
If a native event (e.g., `click`) is defined in the `emits` option, the listener will now only listen to component-emitted `click` events and no longer respond to native `click` events.
